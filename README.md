# hapi-fhir-starter
Starter repository for HAPI FHIR. This is a barebones HAPI FHIR server built on a Postgres database, supporting just one resource (Patient) and one operation (Read).

To see a breakdown of how this repo was built step-by-step, please see the commit history. Each commit is one atomic step!
